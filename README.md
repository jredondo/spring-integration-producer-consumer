# Boilerplate for a Complex Event Processing pipeline using Flink and Spring Integration

Simple Producer -> Flink CEP -> Consumer implementation using [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and [Spring Integration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/overview.html).

This is a step forward on the [Simple Producer/Consumer implementation using Spring Integration](https://github.com/jredondo/spring-integration-producer-consumer).

Basically, a [Complex Event Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing) (or simply a CEP), implemented with [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), has been inserted between the producer and consumer processes.  
Producer and consumer code remain untouched, so they keep being a lean implementation using [Spring Integration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/overview.html). 
For the scope of this repository's experiments, Kafka integration is used between Producer, CEP and Consumer. 

The main purpose is to offer a simple implementation suitable as the starting point for testing the "statefulness" of clustered stream processing using Flink and Kafka.  

The CEP implementation is under cep/ directory.  

#### Docker Swarm:

As with the [Simple Producer/Consumer implementation using Spring Integration](https://github.com/jredondo/spring-integration-producer-consumer) some rudimentary scripts and Dockerfiles for deploying with Docker Swarm are provided in the following directories: 

```
$ ls -l docker 
total 48
... deploy-app-stack.sh
... deploy-cep-stack.sh
... deploy-flink-stack.sh
... deploy-kafka-stack.sh
... docker-app-stack.yml
... docker-cep-stack.yml
... docker-flink-stack.yml
... docker-kafka-stack.yml
... start-kafka-consumer.sh
... start-kafka-producer.sh
... start-swarm.sh
... stop-swarm.sh
$ ls -l producer/docker/
total 12
... Dockerfile
... launch-app.sh
... setup_image.sh
$ ls -l consumer/docker/
total 12
... Dockerfile
... launch-app.sh
... setup_image.sh
$
```

For them to be useful, first you will need to create a Swarm of Docker nodes. 
Have a look at [Docker Swarm Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) to get started.

After that you will need to deploy a [private registry as a service](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/#run-the-registry-as-a-service) 
in your swarm. Notice that all that follow supposes this registry runs over HTTPS. For that purpose [this](https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/948) might be of help.
